## Usage

After building the project, you can integrate it into your Discord bot. Here’s a basic example of how to use the audio streaming functionality:

1. **Set Up Your Discord Bot**:
   Ensure you have a Discord bot set up and running. You can follow the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro) for guidance.

2. **Integrate the Audio Streaming**:
   Import the necessary classes from the `pomiceelavasrc` project into your bot's code. Here’s a simple example:
   ```java
   import com.pomicee.pomiceelavasrc.AudioPlayer;

   public class MyDiscordBot {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           AudioPlayer player = new AudioPlayer();
           // Add your bot logic here
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Play Audio**:
   Use the methods provided by the `AudioPlayer` class to play audio in voice channels.

## Configuration

To configure the audio streaming settings, you may need to adjust the following parameters in your bot's configuration file:

- **Token**: Your Discord bot token.
- **Prefix**: The command prefix for your bot.
- **Audio Source**: Specify the audio source (e.g., YouTube, local files) you want to stream from.

### Example Configuration

```json
{
   "token": "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN",
